# polybot

## Development

To run a local development server:

```
docker-compose up
```

This runs the front-end on http://localhost:8001, and the Corrections API on http://localhost:8001/api.

## Testing

`pytest` can be run for the Python backend libraries.

Front-end and end-to-end tests not yet implemented.
